# smart-drone-software
The folder named "drone" consists of the python files that deal with the input of the location information as well as the formulation of the flight path data.
In this project, the location data was hard-coded for demonstration purposes.

This was a hardware project that was made using a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Neo6M GPS module. The code shown here was uploaded into the Raspberry Pi and run on it to simulate the working of this on a movable device.
